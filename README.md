So I know how I‚Äôd like the interface to look, but I am still working on content. I know this is very abstract so let me know if it‚Äôs too confusing. The colors are purple, black, white, royal blue and gold. You don‚Äôt have to use al of those colors, but those are the colors that I‚Äôve been using on all materials. I can get the RGB color codes if you need them.

Thanks!!

When you first open the app, can it be a page like this to show the black words matter logo and then fade into the main page:

I would like the main page when you open the app to look like this:

However, I would like four sections instead of three. I have a subscription to adobe stock if needed and when we get to that part I have some stock photos I‚Äôd like to use for those sections. Unless you have a particular vision, just let me know. ü§ó I would like to keep the icons at the bottom of the first screen, however, I would like the icons to match the titles which would be (in this order): Topics (a finger hitting a button icon ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), Events (calendar icon), Shop (shopping cart icon), Artists (person silhouette icon). For the artists icon I would this screen with contributor pics and bios:

From the expandable menu at the top right I want the user to be able to see the following options (with corresponding icons): Profile, Our Story, What‚Äôs New?, Ask Us Anything. This is how I would like that page to look (not sure what icon would make sense at the top of this page - any suggestions?):

From the main menu page, when they click on each section, I want them to go to a page that has a layout like this (so you‚Äôll still see the icons at the bottom, as we add more content I think that a search bar would be cool and the different categories at the top, but for launch I don‚Äôt think that is needed. Instead, I‚Äôm thinking where ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù is on this pic, it will be the title of that page...also I can provide you with specific pics if needed):

As I stated above, I don‚Äôt have the full names of each section together yet, but I know what content will be in each section. So next, I will provide you with what will be in each section and show you how I would like that sections tertiary page to look like. So it‚Äôs main menu, then the category page, and then the pages that I‚Äôm about to show you for each category. Lol ok....

Section 1: meditations, affirmations, motivation (my take on the inspirational quotes) - this is how each category slide in this section will look:

Meditations (just the heading at the top - I like the categories at the top and options for each category listed below. When you click on the meditation it will take you to the next audio slide):

Affirmations (I am still developing this idea but I like this look where the audio/quote (screencast video) of the affirmation plays at the top and then the user can journal on the affirmation and write their own, etc. the journal entries would be saved in their profile (next screens):


Motivation (the quick help section won‚Äôt be there though):
<image5.png>


Section 2: audio lessons (as this section grows I would like to add a bit that would be something like what is on the next screen - but that is future state just sharing my thought process üòä):
